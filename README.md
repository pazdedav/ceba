# Cloud Environments Builder for Azure

## Introduction

The goal of CEBA (Cloud Environment Builder for Azure) project is to "translate" several key concepts and recommendations from **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure** ([CAF](https://aka.ms/adopt)) from Microsoft into a **deployable code** (essentially a set of templates, scripts, configuration files, etc.).

The entire repo can be then forked, customized, and deployed to Azure. All components that will deliver parts of the model (monitoring, management, governance, security, etc.) will be deployed and configured.
